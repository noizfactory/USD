"""inserts, appends, or removes USD primitives to/from a USD scene as sublayers"""

== Overview ==

This ROP will insert,append, or remove the contents of source USD files into/from destination USD Files as [USD sublayers.|http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/USD-Glossary.html#USDGlossary-SubLayers]. 


@parameters


Render to Disk:
    Saves the usd reference to disk.

Controls...:
    #id: renderdialog

    Opens the control dialog to allow adjustments of the render parameters
    before rendering.


[Include:standard#valid_frame_range]

Start/End/Inc:
    Specifies the range of frames to render (start frame, end frame, and increment). All values may be floating point values. The range is inclusive. 

    These parameters determine the values of the local variables for the output driver.

	`$NRENDER`:
	    The number of frames to be rendered by the output driver.
	`$N`:
	    The current frame being rendered (starting at 1 and going to `$NRENDER`).

Render with Take:
    #id: take

    Uses the settings in a particular take while rendering. Choose
    __Current__ to use the current take when rendering.

    
== Settings ==
Loop Range:
    This allows you to loop the operation over multiple files by using the token %d as the loop iteration string. For example, say you wanted to insert the following files: source1.usd, source2.usd, source3.usda  into a
    the file destination.usd. You would set your Source  parameter to file%d.usda, the Destination to detination.usd and the loop range to 1 ,3 ,1. 
  
Source:
    File paths to USD files that will be inserted into or removed from the corresponding Destinatation USD file.
Destination:
    File Paths in/from which to insert/remove the corresponding Source USD file.
Operation:
    insert into:
        Inserting places the sublayer at the top of the layer stack making it the strongest opinon, this is most desirable for overlays. 
    append into:
        Appending places the sublayer at the bottom of the stack giving it the weakest opinion which is useful for installing new geometry into a USD scene.
    remove from:
        Removes Source sublayer if it exist in the Destination USD file.
